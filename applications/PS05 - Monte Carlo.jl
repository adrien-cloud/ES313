# Monte Carlo methods
As you will have discovered during the lectures, the term *Monte Carlo* covers a range of techniques that use repeated sampling to solve a complex problem. It can briefly be summarised as:

!!! tip "Monte Carlo"
	Monte Carlo methods are mathematical techniques that use repeated random sampling to estimate numerical results for problems that are difficult to solve analytically. 

	The core idea is to define a domain of inputs, randomly generate samples from that domain according to a probability distribution, perform computations on these samples, and then aggregate the results to approximate quantities such as integrals, expectations, or probabilities.

	By relying on the law of large numbers, Monte Carlo approximations improve in accuracy as the number of random samples increases. These methods are widely used in numerical integration, optimization, and probabilistic modeling where analytical solutions are infeasible or complex.

## Options Pricing in Finance

We found that some students are drawn to financial topics for their projects. Unfortunately, none have managed to predict the market so far, so no Mark Zuckerberg–style school leavers just yet.

Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulation has a very interesting application in the financial markets, which we will discover today.

First, let's cover some basic financial principles:

		!!! info "Definition"
			Quantitative finance is the application of mathematics, especially probability, statistics, and calculus, to model and understand financial markets. The aim is to describe how money, assets, and risks evolve over time in order to price securities, measure risk, and make informed investment decisions.  
		"""
	
	tv_content = md"""
A central idea is the **time value of money**: one euro today is worth more than one euro tomorrow, because it can be invested.  

!!! info "Risk-free interest rate"
	```math

	This is the return on a hypothetical investment with no risk of default, often approximated using government bonds. It acts as the "baseline growth rate" of money.

!!! info "Compound interest"
	If you invest an amount $P$ at an annual interest rate $r$, compounded **continuously**, the value after $t$ years is:
	```math
	V(t) = P e^{rt}
	```
	
	This exponential growth formula is the foundation of discounting and present-value calculations.

Financial markets are uncertain: asset prices move unpredictably.  
This randomness is modeled mathematically using **stochastic processes**.  

!!! info "Volatility"

	A measure of how much the price of an asset fluctuates.  
	- High volatility → larger swings (higher risk and potential reward).

In this application, we will cover the pricing of financial options:

!!! info "Options"
	An **option** is a financial contract granting the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified *strike price* within a specific time frame.

	There are two main types of options:
	* A **call** option gives the right to *buy* the asset.
	* A **put** option gives the right to *sell* the asset.
		
	Options differ by when the holder can exercise them:
	* **European options** can be exercised only at expiration (maturity).
	* **American options** can be exercised *any time* up to and including the expiration date, offering more flexibility.



One frequently used method of modeling stock prices, is with the [**Black-Scholes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model) model, a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. This model makes several assumptions, which we will not all cover here. However, one of the assumptions is the **Random walk**: 

!!! info "Random Walk"
	The instantaneous log return of the stock price is an infinitesimal random walk with drift; more precisely, the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, and it is assumed that the drift and volatility of the motion are constant.


Thus, the properties of the [**Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) can be used to simulate the stock prices. These prices are assumed to evolve continuously, with random fluctuations capturing market uncertainty. The GBM model defines that the logarithmic returns of the stock price follow a normal distribution, leading to the stock price itself following a lognormal distribution over time.

This leads to  For this application we will consider European options with a fixed interest and volatility. We will cover two approaches:
* Through MC simulation
* Through mathematical derivation

The interested reader is encouraged to consult the references provided.

### GBM

!!! info "Mathematical Model"
	An option on equity may be modelled with one source of uncertainty: the price of the underlying stock in question. Here the price of the underlying instrument $S_t$ is modelled such that it follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift $\mu$ ($=r$) and volatility $\sigma$. So
	```math
	dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
	```
	where $W_t$ is a so-called *Wiener process* conforming to standard Brownian motion. $dW_t$ is found via random sampling from a normal distribution.

	The discrete approximation then takes the form, over a timestep $\Delta t$:
	```math
	S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \times e^{\left(\left( \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \right) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} Z_t \right)}
	```
	where $Z_t$ is a sample from a standard normal distribution.

This brings us to following MC steps:

!!! tip "MC steps"
	1. *Initialize*: Set the initial price $S_0$, drift $\mu$, volatility $\sigma$ and simulation horizon $T$.
	2. *Discretize*: Steps $\Delta t$
	3. *Simulate multiple paths*: Run the simulation multiple times and get multiple sequences.
	4. *Analyze*: Extract relevant information, *in casu* option prices.

The option pricing can then be obtained.

!!! info "Option Pricing"
	The price you should charge for an option can then easily be computed using:
	* **Call**:
	```math
	P_i = \max(S_i - K, 0)
	```
	Leading to
	```math
	P = \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \times e^{-r T}
	```
	
	* **Put**:
	```math
	P_i = \max(K - S_i, 0)
	```
	Leading to
	```math
	P = \bar{\boldsymbol{P}} \times e^{-r T}
	```
	where $i$ refers to the index of your simulation instance and the exponential term is included for discounting the intrinsic value back to present value.

	* Variable $\sigma$ : volatility of the underlying asset  
	* Variable $T$ : time to maturity  
	* Variable $N(\cdot)$ : cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution

	The price for a **call** option is:
	```math
	C = S_0 \, N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
	```

	The price for a **put** option is:

## Bayesian Inference
One of the applications you covered during the lectures, is Bayesian inference. To reiterate:

!!! info "Basic Proba"
	We learned that:

	```math
	P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)
	```

	And at the same time:

	```math
	P(B \cap A) = P(B | A) P(A)
	```

	Thus:
	```math
	P(A | B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
	```

The expressions for continuous distributions are analogous, which leads directly to Bayesian inference:


!!! info "Bayesian Inference"
	Bayesian inference is a statistical method for updating our knowledge about unknown parameters based on observed data. It combines a prior belief about the parameters with the likelihood of the observed data to produce a posterior distribution, which represents the updated belief after considering the evidence.

	```math
	P(\theta | y ) = \frac{P( y  | \theta ) \cdot P(\theta)}{P(y)},
	```
	where $\theta$ are the parameters, $y$ represents the data, $P(\theta | y)$ represents the posterior, $P( y  | \theta )$ the likelihood and $P(\theta)$ the prior.

	This framework allows continuous refinement of beliefs as new data becomes available, making Bayesian inference a powerful tool for statistical modeling and decision-making.

## Model Fitting
In this practical session, we will use Bayesian inference for an extremely common problem in the engineering sciences: model fitting. We can show that a Bayesian approach offers considerable advantages with respect to the traditional deterministic methods:
- In stead of point estimates, you obtain a distribution.
- You can incorporate prior knowledge into the model based on physical limitations.

If we use the angle $\alpha$ of our straight line rather than the slope $\theta_1$ (i.e. ``\theta_1 = \tan \alpha``), it is easier to choose a prior:
```math
\alpha \sim \mathcal{U}(-\pi/2, +\pi/2)
```
To compute the PDF of $\theta_1 = \tan(\alpha)$ given a prior on $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \sim \mathcal{U}(-\pi/2, +\pi/2)$), you use the change of variables formula for transforming random variables:

Let $f_\alpha(\alpha)$ be the PDF of $\alpha$. For the transformation $\theta_1 = \tan(\alpha)$, the PDF of $\theta_1$ is:
```math
f_{\theta_1}(\theta_1) = f_\alpha(\arctan(\theta_1)) \left| \frac{d}{d\theta_1} \arctan(\theta_1) \right| = f_\alpha(\alpha) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \theta_1^2}
```

For a uniform prior $\alpha \sim \mathcal{U}(-\pi/2,+\pi/2)$, the density is $f_\alpha(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\pi}$ for $\alpha$ in that interval, so:
```math
f_{\theta_1}(\theta_1) = \frac{1}{\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \theta_1^2}
```


for all real $\theta_1$, since $\arctan(\theta_1)$ maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $(-\pi/2, +\pi/2)$.

This means $\theta_1$ follows a standard Cauchy distribution if $\alpha$ is uniform over $(-\pi/2, +\pi/2)$.

**In summary**: If you sample $\alpha$ uniformly on $(-\pi/2, +\pi/2)$ and work with $\theta_1 = \tan(\alpha)$, $\theta_1$ is distributed according to the standard Cauchy PDF:

f_{\theta_1}(\theta_1) = \frac{1}{\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \theta_1^2}

For the analysis of the results, we will follow a dual approach:
!!! tip "Analysis"
	* First and foremost we represent our data as a histogram, on which we identify the mean and confidence interval.
	* Secondly, we must verify whether or not our sampling was succesful. This implies making sure that the algorithm did not get stuck in a local maximum. We will do this by plotting the 'trace'. A trace plot shows the sampled values of a parameter across the iterations of the MCMC algorithm. It helps visualize how the Markov chain explores the parameter space over time. A good trace plot looks “noisy” without obvious trends, oscillating around a stable mean, indicating that the chain has reached its target (stationary) distribution and mixes well. Poor trace plots may show trends, slow movement, or get stuck, which signal issues like lack of convergence or poor mixing.
